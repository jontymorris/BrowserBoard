# BrowserBoard
A central hub for your media.

## What is BrowserBoard
BrowserBoard is the homepage you never had. It will keep track of your favourite things and will even alert you to any updates.

## Getting setup
You will need to have a version of Python 3 and Django installed in order to run BrowserBoard. It is also recommended that you make BrowserBoard your homepage in whatever browser you're using.

The simpliest way to install Django is via pip.
```
pip install django
```

To run the server, cd to the BrowserBoard directory and then run the following command.
```
python manage.py runserver
```
