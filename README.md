# Linker
A central hub for your media.

## What is Linker
Linker is the homepage you never had. It will keep track of your favourite things and will alert you to any updates.

## Getting setup
You will need to have a version of Python 3 and Django installed in order to run Linker. It is also recommended that you make Linker your homepage in whatever browser you're using.
